Data Information:
There are 113,937 loans in the dataset with 81 features. Most variables are both numeric and categorical in nature.

The dataset features can be split into two main categories: Borrower information & Loan performance information.

The analysis mainly focuses on the impacts to the loans by different variables, such as credit ratings, income, estimated returns and debt-income ratios etc.

Findings are following:

The numbers of each status of loans, of which about 12000 are Charged-off, namely 21% are unlikely to be collected, while about 5000 are Defaulted, it takes about 9%.

People prefer loans with 36 month payment range.

The maximum of loan takers' monthly income is ranging between 50000 and 60000.

Most loan takers have a debt-income ratio of 20%, the distribution skews to the right.

The borrow rates are centered from 0.1 to 0.3, while the investor number is more spread out.

The majority of loan takers have an income range from 25000 to 50000.

Most of the loan takers are set in the income range of 25000 to 74999, while with lower rating scores. Except for the 75000 100000 session.

As the credit rating goes higher, the estimated return goes lower, so does income range, but not as obvious as credit rating does.
